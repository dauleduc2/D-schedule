maintenance project : 
    - reuse func need to write at a file and export :
        + close and open the chooseDayBox, AddEventPage and GrayLayer
        + make sure the components don't have any useSelector for fetch data from anywhere, only dispatcher
    - container and conponents
        + chooseDayBox can be a components?
        + the main container is App.js --> SchedulePage + ??? --> components
        + configInformation is const or commons? check it on google then fix it
    - UX & UI :
        + Think more about the font of text in the app, the title of schedule in schedulePage look bad
            * font-family
            * letter spacing
        + animation on appear & disappear the AddEventPage and chooseDayBox components
        + color & outline on selected & unselected box
